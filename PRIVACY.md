This application does **not** collect or transmit any personal or identifiable information.

3\. Cookies and Tracking

This application does not use cookies or any form of tracking technologies.

4\. Local Data Storage
----------------------

All application data — including but not limited to your task entries, configuration settings, and preferences — is stored **locally** on your device using browser-based local storage (e.g., `localStorage`). This means:

We do **not** share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties under any circumstance. Since no data is collected, there is nothing to disclose, sell, or misuse.

6\. Security
------------

While we do not transmit or store data externally, we encourage users to protect access to their own devices. As local storage is handled by your browser, the integrity and confidentiality of your data rely on your local environment.

7\. User Control
----------------

You have full control over your data. You may:

*   Clear your browser’s local storage to delete all stored data

No remote deletion, restoration, or synchronization features are provided.
